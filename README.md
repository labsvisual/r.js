# R.js
A small Javascript library
***
R is a learning project for myself to see if I could somewhat mimic jQuery in a minimal and concise manner. It has the same method names to make it easier and most of the code is based on the code provided on [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com).

My idea was to keep the structure very simple and concise, so that developers could select the methods they actually need and remove the rest, so that you don't have any bloat or unneeded code in your library. The current file size is 6.74KB, 2.25KB when minifyed.

All and any help is appreciated of course. Suggestions on other methods are welcome too.
